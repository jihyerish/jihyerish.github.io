# sw-test

Service Worker test repository. This is a very simple demo to show basic service worker features in action. The demo can be seen on [our GitHub pages](https://mdn.github.io/sw-test/).

You can find a lot more out about how this works by reading [Using Service Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API/Using_Service_Workers). 
In particular, read [Why is my service worker failing to register?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API/Using_Service_Workers#Why_is_my_service_worker_failing_to_register) 
if you are having problems getting your code to do anything.
